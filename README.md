# why would I need it anyway?? ðŸ‘½

Now enough of this shit. :alien:

## What and Why is the reason I made this website on github?

I hate getting this same shi goin through my mail (Stop this)
I'm tired of this cheetoz spamming my mail tellin me to stop hosting website with github when there's plenty of web-hosting services like (hostinger, 000webhost, etc.)
The reason I hosted in github is it's free! ðŸ’¯ forever free!! (I don't have any money)
And the second reason is, I'm 17 ofc, LIKE WTH YOU MEAN HOSTING ON PAID PLANS WHEN I DON'T HAVE ANY ACCOUNT (banks)

This is me when no money:
